# Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Overview

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a fundamental metric used in regression analysis to evaluate the accuracy of a model. It measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted values and the actual values without considering their direction. The MAE is an effective way to gauge how well a model is performing, providing insight into the average size of the errors made by the model.

## Formula

The Mean Absolute Error is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of observations,
- \( y_i \) is the actual value,
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value.

## Interpretation

- **MAE** gives an idea of the average error magnitude, with all errors weighted equally.
- A **lower MAE** indicates a better fit of the model to the data, implying smaller errors on average.
- Unlike other metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), MAE does not square the errors, meaning it is not as sensitive to outliers.

## Advantages

- **Intuitive and Simple**: MAE is easy to understand and interpret, making it a popular choice for evaluating regression models.
- **Robust to Outliers**: Unlike MSE, MAE is less sensitive to large errors or outliers because it does not square the errors.

## Disadvantages

- **Does Not Penalize Large Errors**: Since MAE only considers the absolute magnitude of errors, it does not give extra weight to larger errors, which might be a downside in certain applications.
- **Less Differentiating**: MAE can sometimes be less sensitive in differentiating between models, especially when large errors are present.

## Use Cases

- **Regression Analysis**: MAE is commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression models, particularly when the focus is on the magnitude of errors rather than their squared impact.
- **Forecasting Models**: In time series forecasting, MAE is often used to measure the accuracy of predictions.

## Comparison with Other Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: MSE squares the errors before averaging, which means it penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones. This makes MSE more sensitive to outliers compared to MAE.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE is the square root of MSE, providing an error measure in the same units as the target variable, but still penalizing larger errors more heavily than MAE.

## Python Implementation

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to calculate Mean Absolute Error using Python:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Example data
y_true = [3.0, -0.5, 2.0, 7.0]
y_pred = [2.5, 0.0, 2.0, 8.0]

# Calculate MAE
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
