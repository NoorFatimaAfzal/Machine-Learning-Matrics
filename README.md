## Introduction

Machine learning metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of models. This repository provides comprehensive notes and code examples for various metrics used in regression and classification tasks.

## Regression Metrics

Regression metrics are used to evaluate the performance of regression models, which predict continuous values. The following metrics are covered:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## Classification Metrics

Classification metrics are used to evaluate the performance of classification models, which predict categorical labels. The following metrics are covered:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC

## Usage

To use the code examples in this repository, clone the repository and navigate to the desired metric's folder. Each folder contains a detailed Jupyter notebook with explanations and code examples.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NoorFatimaAfzal/Machine-Learning-Metrics.git
cd Machine-Learning-Metrics
